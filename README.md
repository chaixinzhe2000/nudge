# How to begin your Nudge journey ðŸš€

1. Download Expo Go from App Store.
2. Open terminal and run the command "yarn." You may need to install yarn first  
   using npm.
3. Run the command "expo start." A new window should open up on your browser.
4. Scan the QR code in your terminal or on the web page using the camera app on  
   your phone.
5. Expo Go should open automatically. Note that it could take up to a minute  
   when you are first running the code.
6. You can go through the prompts on the screen and register to see what the  
   application looks like for a new user.
7. You can also log into our demo account (see below for account information),  
   which has some sample contacts and tasks, to get a better feel of how the  
   application works.
8. Have fun! ðŸŽ¶
